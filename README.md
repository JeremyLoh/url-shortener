# URL Shortener

Create a RESTful API that allows users to shorten long URLs. The API should provide endpoints to create, retrieve, update, and delete short URLs. It should also provide statistics on the number of times a short URL has been accessed.

![high level application feature](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/url-shortener-architecture-u72mu.png)

# Requirements

API should allow users to perform the following operations:

- Create a new short URL
- Retrieve an original URL from a short URL
- Update an existing short URL
- Delete an existing short URL
- Get statistics on the short URL (e.g number of times accessed)

You can optionally setup a minimal frontend to interact with the API and setup redirects for the short URLs to the original URLs

# API Endpoints

## Create Short URL

Create a new short URL using the `POST` method

```
POST /shorten
{
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/long/url"
}
```

The endpoint should validate the request body and return a `201 Created` status code with the newly created short URL

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/long/url",
  "shortCode": "abc123",
  "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Or a `400 Bad Request` status code with error messages in case of validation errors. Short codes MUST be unique and should be generated randomly

## Retrieve Original URL

Retrieve the original URL from a short URL using the `GET` method

```
GET /shorten/abc123
```

The endpoint should return a `200 OK` status code with the original URL

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/long/url",
  "shortCode": "abc123",
  "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z"
}
```

Or a `404 Not Found` status code if the short URL was not found. Your frontend should be responsible for retrieving the original URL using the short URL and redirecting the user to the original URL

## Update Short URL

Update an existing short URL using the `PUT` method

```
PUT /shorten/abc123
{
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/updated/url"
}
```

The endpoint should validate the request body and return a `200 OK` status code with the updated short URL

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/updated/url",
  "shortCode": "abc123",
  "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2021-09-01T12:30:00Z"
}
```

or a `400 Bad Request` status code with error messages in case of validation errors. It should return a `404 Not Found` status code if the short URL was not found

## Delete Short URL

Delete an existing short URL using the `DELETE` method

```
DELETE /shorten/abc123
```

The endpoint should return a `204 No Content` status code if the short URL was successfully deleted or a `404 Not Found` status code if the short URL was not found

## Get URL Statistics

Get statistics for a short URL using the `GET` method

```
GET /shorten/abc123/stats
```

The endpoint should return a `200 OK` status code with the statistics

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "url": "https://www.example.com/some/long/url",
  "shortCode": "abc123",
  "createdAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
  "updatedAt": "2021-09-01T12:00:00Z",
  "accessCount": 10
}
```

or a `404 Not Found` status code if the short URL was not found

# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ["./tsconfig.node.json", "./tsconfig.app.json"],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from "eslint-plugin-react"

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: "18.3" } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs["jsx-runtime"].rules,
  },
})
```
